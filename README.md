## Introduction

The AI Hand Gesture Recognition program is designed to analyze live video input from your webcam and identify various hand gestures. It uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to process the images and classify the hand motions into specific gestures, such as open palm, fist, thumbs up, and more.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- [hand_motion_recognizer.py](hand_motion_recognizer.py) - Python script for implementing the hand gesture recognition program.
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) - A list of required Python packages to run the program.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AI Hand Gesture Recognition program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** locally using `git clone [repository_url]`.
2. **Install the required Python packages** by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Ensure you have a webcam** connected to your system.
4. **Run the `hand_motion_recognizer.py` script** to start the hand gesture recognition.
5. **Perform hand gestures in front of the webcam** to see real-time recognition in action.

## Usage

The AI Hand Gesture Recognition program uses deep learning models and computer vision techniques to identify and classify hand gestures captured through the webcam. For optimal performance, make sure the webcam has good lighting conditions, and your hand movements are distinct and clear.
